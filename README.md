# FAPE
Flexible Automated Pipeline Engine (FAPE)


## How to run FAPE
> cd FAPE.dist
> ./FAPE

Executable supports Unix-like Operating Systems; it has been tested on Mac OS X and Ubuntu.


## Testing
A testing pipeline based on the module (i.e., 'test') located into 'modules' is available. Furthermore, a set of synthetic files (.fq.gz) are located into 'samples'.
Note that both testing module and synthetic files DO NOT PRODUCE an output, these are only for testing.
We invite you to use a real pipeline based on non-testing modules to produce a valid output.
